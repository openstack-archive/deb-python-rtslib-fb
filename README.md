rtslib-fb
=========

A Python object API for managing the Linux LIO kernel target
------------------------------------------------------------
rtslib-fb is an object-based Python library for configuring the LIO
generic SCSI target, present in 3.x Linux kernel versions.

It supports both Python 2 and Python 3, thanks to the python-six library.

rtslib-fb development
---------------------
rtslib-fb is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. Contributions are welcome.

Since rtslib-fb is used most often with targetcli-fb, the targetcli-fb
mailing should be used for rtslib-fb discussion.

Packages
--------
rtslib-fb is packaged for a number of Linux distributions including
RHEL,
[Fedora](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/python-rtslib),
openSUSE, Arch Linux,
[Gentoo](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/dev-python/rtslib-fb), and

"fb" -- "free branch"
---------------------

rtslib-fb is a fork of the "rtslib" code written by RisingTide Systems.
The "-fb" differentiates between the original and this version.
Please ensure to use either all "fb" versions of the targetcli components --
targetcli, rtslib, and configshell, or stick with all non-fb versions, since
they are no longer strictly compatible.
